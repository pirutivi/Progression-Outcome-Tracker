# Progression Outcome Tracker

## Overview
This Python program is designed to determine and visualize student progression outcomes based on their credit scores in three categories: Pass, Defer, and Fail. It also generates a bar chart to represent the total count of each outcome.

## Features
- Accepts user input for pass, defer, and fail credits.
- Validates input to ensure correct integer values and total credit sum.
- Categorizes outcomes into **Progress**, **Module Trailer**, **Module Retriever**, or **Exclude**.
- Displays a bar chart to visualize the outcomes.
- Allows multiple data entries until the user chooses to quit.

## Progression Outcomes
- **Progress:** The student has passed with 120 credits.
- **Module Trailer:** The student is eligible for module trailing.
- **Module Retriever:** The student needs to retake modules.
- **Exclude:** The student is excluded from the program.
